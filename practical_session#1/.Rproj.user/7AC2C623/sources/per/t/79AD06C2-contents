Read dataset. 
```{r}
df<-read.csv("bwght.csv", sep=",")
head(df)
```

Plot the variables *bwght* and *cigs* in a scatter plot. Discuss the relationship between these variables.
```{r}
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(df)+
  geom_point(aes(x = df$cigs, y = df$bwght))+
  ggtitle("Relationship between birthweight of child and cigs smoked per day")+
  xlab("Cigarettes smoked per day") + ylab("Birth weight of a child")
cor(df$cigs, df$bwght) #-0.1507618
```
Task 2. Explain why we expect causality between the two variables *bwght* and *cigs*.
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy

Discuss if the model satisfies the basic assumptions of the SLR. 
#Assumption SLR1 (linear in parameters) is satisfied because we assume the linear relationship between the variables
#Assumption SLR2 (random sampling) is satisfied because the data is a survey which use randomizationg in methodology
#Assumption SLR3 (zero conditional mean) - wait for the next slide

In particular do we expect correlation between the error and the regressor? 

What is the consequence of this correlation? How is it called in econometrics?

Task 3.

Task 4.
```{r}
model_1 <- lm(bwght ~ cigs, data = df)
summary(model_1)
#nrow(df)
```
119.77190 - Intercept (basically our alpha in the equation). Thus the average birth weight of the child for non-smoking female is 119 whatever the measurment is.
Slope: each additional cigarette smoked is associated with 0.51 lower birth weight.

#The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. 

#The coefficient Standard Error measures the average amount that the coefficient estimates vary from the actual average value of our response variable.
